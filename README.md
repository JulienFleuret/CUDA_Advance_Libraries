# Segmentation model tester
I did this project in the context of the module "CUDA Advance Libraries" from Coursera.

## Project Description

This project creates an executable named `segmentation_model_tester.exe`. This executable utilizes `libtorch`, the C++ frontend of `pytorch`, and is designed for evaluating the performance of a segmentation model after serialization between C++ and Python.
